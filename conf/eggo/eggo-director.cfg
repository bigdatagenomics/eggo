[dfs]
; The location of the result data sets in the targeted distributed file system

; raw data ends up in <dfs_raw_data_url>/<dataset_name>

; tmp data ends up in <dfs_root_url>/<dfs_tmp_data_dir>/<dataset_name>/<random_id>

[execution]
; The context for execution. Possible values are spark_ec2, director, local.
; There are config sections for each of the possible values.
context: director
