[dfs]
; The location of the result data sets in the targeted distributed file system

; Path to stage the raw input data on the target distributed fs
; raw data ends up in <dfs_raw_data_url>/<dataset_name>

; Path to store tmp/intermediate data in the target distributed fs
; tmp data ends up in <dfs_root_url>/<dfs_tmp_data_dir>/<dataset_name>/<random_id>

[execution]
; The context for execution. Possible values are spark_ec2, director, local.
; There are config sections for each of the possible values.
context: director

; Random identifier that is generated on module load.  Do not set this manually
